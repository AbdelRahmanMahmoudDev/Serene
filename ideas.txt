Problem:
- Trying to figure out how to move specific elements around

Solution:
- I could write move functions specific to the player, but then what happens when I want to write procedures for other elements? [Done]
- Group entities, so that specific procedures apply to specific groups

Problem:
- Colliding with stuff, movement, physics

Solution:
- To properly do this, we need to have the world representation figured out
- Write my own stuff (Long time, lots of reading)
- Use Box2d (Learning resource, good documentation) and if I end up not liking something it does, I could modify it 
  or come up with my own stuff eventually
 
Problem:
- World representation

Solution:
- A system that gives an accurate representation of where entities are in a "world"
- A tile map system?
- A screen is 16 tiles across and 9 tiles high
- A pixels to meters conversion for multiple resolutions
- A bunch of chunks, each chunk has a bunch of tile
- Let's say, each tile is 1x1 meters
- How much is a meter? 50, 60, 70 ?
- I'll let it be multiples of 20, divides evenly with the 16:9 ratio: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, ...
- Transform pixel coordinates to tile coordinates (which tile we're on) [TODO TOMORROW] 
- Don't want to constrain tile count to screen resolution, want to keep word size in memory [tile chunks]

 Problem:
 - Levels

 Solution:
 - Can a level be an empty container that gets stuff added to it?

 OpenGL broke hot reloading!

 Communicating between the CPU and the GPU on a dll is a big mistake!
